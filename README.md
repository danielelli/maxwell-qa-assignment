# Maxwell QA Automation Code Exercise

Requirements for this task:
#### Create a smoke test to verify web page functionality
Using Selenium, Playwright, or any other open source automated testing framework, verify the demo account landing page at https://snap.modernemortgage.com/home/mobile-test
* Test 1: The page displays an email address for the Lender.
* Test 2: After clicking the "Apply Now" button, the resulting page displays the same email address as in Test 1.

#### Setup
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/danielelli/maxwell-qa-assignment.git`
2. Go to the within the cloned repo, go to the test directory and run playwright test: <br>
`cd maxwell-qa-assignment && cd test && npx playwright test`

#### Considerations for this assignments
- For this project, I wanted to get hands-on with the testing framework utilized within Maxwell so I learned the basics of Playwright using the Playwright Documentation if I ever needed assistance.
- To ensure I was picking the correct element, I noticed that in the Documentation itself Playwright recommended using text locators for non interactive elements like `div`, `span`, `p`. However in the case of looking for a link element `a`, they suggest role locators so I made sure to consider that going into this assignment.
